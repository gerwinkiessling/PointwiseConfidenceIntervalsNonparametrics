# On Pointwise Confidence Intervals in Nonparametric Regression

This repository includes my paper on pointwise confidence intervals in nonparametric regression and the code of this paper. I wrote this paper for my research module in econometrics and statistics at Bonn University.

Here is a link to the CPS data set: http://ceprdata.org/cps-uniform-data-extracts/march-cps-supplement/march-cps-data/

I use the data set from 2017.
